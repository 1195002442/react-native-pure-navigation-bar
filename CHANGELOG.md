# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.5

* Add support for translucent props.
    * If status bar is translucent, you should set it to `true` and the top part of navigation bar is `transparent`.
    * If status bar is not translucent, you should set it to `false` and navigation bar's background color will be `white` everywhere.
